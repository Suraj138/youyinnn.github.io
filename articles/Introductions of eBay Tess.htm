<h4 id="0-what-is-tess">0. What is Tess?</h4>
<p>Tess.IO is eBay’s cluster manager, with a vision of ensuring a world-class <strong>build, ship and run</strong> experience for eBay’s applications at scale, while ensuring high efficiency, security, and agility to the developers. Tess.IO leverages Kubernetes under its hood. Kubernetes (commonly referred to as “k8s”) is an open source container cluster manager that aims to provide a “platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts.”</p>
<p>Tess makes DevOps a breeze.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, you don&#39;t have to setup k8s or docker on your server anymore.</p>
<p>Tess is not an new tech, it&#39;s a plus-version of k8s cli with eBay&#39;s own way.</p>

<h4 id="01-further-reading">0.1. Further Reading</h4>
<p>To best introduce topics, the following instructions suggest a way of consuming this documentation such that topics build upon previous topics.</p>
<p>First, you’ll want to understand what Tess.IO is. For this, read the <a href="https://tess.io/userdocs/getting-start/intro">Introduction</a>. Next, you’ll want to set up your machine with the necessary tools and configuration to talk to Tess.IO. For this, read <a href="https://tess.io/userdocs/getting-start/setup">Setup</a>. Finally, you’ll want to run the <a href="https://tess.io/userdocs/getting-start/hello-world">Hello World</a> example.</p>
<p>From here, you can branch out depending on your needs. Consider starting with <a href="https://tess.io/userdocs/getting-start/models">Model Workloads</a> followed by <a href="https://tess.io/userdocs/getting-start/build-and-deploy">Build and Deploy</a>.</p>
<p>For a better understanding of Kubernetes we recommend reading the following documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/home">documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/object-management-kubectl/declarative-config/">Declarative</a> configuration files</li>
<li>Kubernetes <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/examples">examples</a>.</li>
<li>Kubernetes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIivdWyY5sqL3xfXz5xJvwzFW_tlQB_GB">best practices</a>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I strongly recommends Tess user would have basic knowledge of k8s, otherwise you will get some trouble and you don&#39;t event know how to fix it.</p>
<p>Anyway, keep learning.</p>

<p>As Tess member said, we can create Application using -f option to create app with file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ tskb create -f app.yaml</code></pre>
<p>and the app.yaml file may look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">apiVersion: apps.tess.io/v1alpha1
