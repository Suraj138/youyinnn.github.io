## English Termiologies

### Mathmatics

#### Floating Point Numbers

##### Left & Right

There are two **terminologies** that I'm familiar with. Sometimes, the part to the right of the decimal (cents) is called the ***mantissa***, and the part to the left (dollars, in your metaphor), is called the ***characteristic***.

But I also like the generic terms ***integer-part*** and ***fractional-part***. It's what I and those with whom I do research call them (who uses the word mantissa routinely? not me, but perhaps someone). Yes, I know the fractional part doesn't actually have to be a fraction, but that's just something I toss into my big bag of math vagaries.
