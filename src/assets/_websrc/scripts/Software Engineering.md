   > I feel like the nomenclature causes confusion and should be rethought. Sharing for the sake of a slightly different perspective.
   >
   > "User Scenario" should be "User Story"; because it tells the reader a "story" about what is happening to the user, high level goals and approaches to achieving the goal. By definition, a "story" is a "narrative", and a "User Scenario" is also a "narrative".
   >
   > "User Story" should be something like "User Spec"; because it is a short-form functional requirement that addresses something very specific, ie, a specification. The standard template for a User Story is "As a [data analysts], John can [create a graph from the data table], so that he can [visualize trends in the data]". That, in my opinion, is not much of a "story".
   >
   > "Use Case" is appropriate.
