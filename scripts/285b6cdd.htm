          <h5 id="ef97d642">Left &amp; Right</h5><p>There are two <strong>terminologies</strong> that I&#39;m familiar with. Sometimes, the part to the right of the decimal (cents) is called the <strong><em>mantissa</em></strong>, and the part to the left (dollars, in your metaphor), is called the <strong><em>characteristic</em></strong>.</p>
<p>But I also like the generic terms <strong><em>integer-part</em></strong> and <strong><em>fractional-part</em></strong>. It&#39;s what I and those with whom I do research call them (who uses the word mantissa routinely? not me, but perhaps someone). Yes, I know the fractional part doesn&#39;t actually have to be a fraction, but that&#39;s just something I toss into my big bag of math vagaries.</p>
